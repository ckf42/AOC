# AOC

My solutions for [AOC](https://adventofcode.com/)

Language:
* python (3.11; major)
* ruby (3.2; only a few, no clue when I wrote these)
* c++ (17; need to compile with `-lcpr`, porting)

Put `session` cookie in the top directory and copy `AOCInit` to every subdirectory

Third party python libraries:
* [ortools](https://developers.google.com/optimization)
* [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [scipy](https://scipy.org/)
* [sympy](https://www.sympy.org/)

Third party c++ libraries:
* [C++ Request](https://github.com/libcpr/cpr)
